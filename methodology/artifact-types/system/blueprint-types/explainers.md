# Explainer

Explainer files can be used to record explanations of advanced technical concepts in non-technical terms for those new to the problem domain. Store them alongside related definitions in the Blueprint layer (e.g., under `intents/blueprints/<scope>/` or `intents/system/<feature>/blueprints/`).
